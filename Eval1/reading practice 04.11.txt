JOB APPLICATION
I am interested in this job because I am currently looking for an
opportunity to use the skills I learnt in my college. I have recently
completed a 16-week part-time accounting course (AAT Level 2
Certificate). The course covered book-keeping, recording income and
receipts and basic costing. We used a wide range of computer
packages, and I picked up the accounting skills easily. I was able to work
alone with very little extra help. I passed the course with merit. I believe
my success was due to my thorough work, my numeracy skills and my
attention to detail. During the course, I had experience of working to
deadlines and working under pressure. Although this was sometimes
stressful, I always completed my work on time.
Unfortunately, the course did not include a work placement, so I have
not practised my skills in a business setting, and I am now looking for an
opportunity to do so. I am particularly looking for a job in a small
company such as yours, as I believe I will be able to interact with a wider
range of people, and as a result, learn more skills. I would like to
progress within a company and gain more responsibilities over the
years.
Although I do not have work experience in finance, I have experience in
working in an office environment. Before starting the accounting
course, I worked for 6 months in a recruitment office as a receptionist.
My duties involved meeting and greeting clients and visitors, taking
phone calls, audio and copy typing and checking stock. I also had to
keep the petty cash and mail records. Through this work, I developed
my verbal and written communication skills. I had to speak confidently
to strangers and deliver clear messages. I enjoyed working in a team
environment. I believe the office appreciated my friendly manner and
efficient work.
